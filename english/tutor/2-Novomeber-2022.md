Declarative Sentence - A sentence that makes a statement

‘She was one of those pretty, delightful girls who, apparently by some error of
Fate, get themselves born the daughters of very minor civil servants. She had
no dowry, no expectations, no means of meeting some rich, important man who
would understand, love, and marry her. So she went along with a proposal made
by a junior clerk in the Ministry of Education’

The power of three is used to emphasise the point to the reader. The sentence
"no dowry, no expectations, no means of meeting some rich, important man"
emphasises that she's going to be stuck in the same class she was born in for
the rest of her life as she marries a "Junior clerk" which shows her class has
not changed, and her wealth is determined by a patriarchal society.

Woman had no rights, and the only way to get anywhere in life is to use their
looks and the connections their family knows.

They were given greater status and orientates because they had money.

They believed they desired more then they had.

She fails to see the value in her life, and only believes wealth and material
items would make her happy.

We are only given Madame Loisel's name at this point as she's not important
compared to her husband. The invitation is sent to both of them but the husband
gets it and reads it as he has more power as the man. She's upset about the
invitation as she's not wealthy and doesn't have anything nice to wear. The
writer is putting across once again that the character of Madame Loisel only
Sees the value in material things.
