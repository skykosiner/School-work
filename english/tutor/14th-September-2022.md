## Question 1
Adeline prefers to be at school rather then being at home. The writer uses an
ellipsis in the first paragraph to show that she's thinking about her future
and what will happen.

Another example is, Adeline prefers to be at home over school. The use of
the simile in the last sentence, "The thought of leaving school throbbed at the
back of my mind like a persistent toothache", suggests, to the reader
that just like a toothache, Adeline feels pain when she thinks of having to
leave school. Furthermore, the use of onomatopoeia in "throbbed" indicates the
pain she feels.

## Question 3
Adeline feels intimidated by the verb summoned. This makes the whole sentence
feel cold and doesn't sound like a healthy relationship between a father and a
daughter.

Futhermore, Adeline feels nervous. The adverb, "timidly" indicates that she was
nervous when she knocked on her fathers door.

In addition, she doesn't understand why her father is treating her so nicely.
The adjective, "uneasy" shows a sense of discomfort with why she's being treated
so nicely.

## Question 4
Suddenly Adeline and her fathers relationship dynamic has changed into a
happier relationship. The adjective, "proud" helps us to understand that unlike
what we have heard before about Adeline's relationship with her father this
time he is happy with her for once, as she has won the competition.

Adeline's father is happy to have her as a daughter and not disgusted like he
usually is. The adverb, "pleased" shows that he's happy to talk about his
daughter know and not be ashamed of her.

## Question 5
Adeline feels immensely happy. The use of the adjective, "marvellous" indicates
that Adeline is feeling extremely happy, as she's able to go off to England and
fulfill her dreams.
