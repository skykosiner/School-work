## What makes Zephaniahs writing so vivid in paragraphs 3 - 6?
The first thing that affects me is that the teacher is rude to Zephaniah. He
says "Shut up stupid boy". The language here is demeaning, and embarrassing
towards the writer, and makes him look stupid towards his peers.

In addition the teacher is abusing her power. She says "How dare you challenge
me?". The verb "dare" shows that the teacher feels she should be the only one
in control and she won't allow him to defy her.
