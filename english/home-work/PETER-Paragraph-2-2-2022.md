Title: PETER Paragraph
Date: 2 Feb 2022

In the poem, we can see that the people of Sarajevo are struggling to
survive the war. The evidence for this is from one of the many quotes backing
up this point "queuing for the precious meagre grams of bread there rationed to
each day". The technique that the poet has used is rhyming couplets. The quote
shows the struggle that the Sarajevo people are going through right now. They
have to cue for hours just for a bit of food, that is not even going to fill
them. So as the question asks "The way he is creating imagery", we can start to
get an image in our head from the line "meagre grams of bread". You're getting
an image of how difficult it is for them to get anything.
