After Jeff finally finishes moving into his new house he is tied, so Jeff

explore.

But the second Jeff gets downstairs all the lights starts to flicker, and the
doors are opening and closing by them self. Jeff starts to panic. Jeff seems to
have a surprise visitor. By the time Jeff starts to run out of the house the
visitor starts pulling Jeff away from the door.

## A Surprise Visitor
Jeff had finally done it; after years of planning he had manged to get enough
money together to move into his new house. The house felt old and creepy, yet
also had a homily feeling to it. Jeff was knackered, he has spent all day
moving things into his new house, with no time to rest. Jeff decided to go up
stairs and try out his new bed, just as the grandfather clock struck 7pm.

As Jeff gets into the bed he falls asleep in minutes. But his sleep in not
peaceful for long. The grandfather clock strikes 8pm, it had somehow made it's
way into Jeff's room, waking him up. Jeff begins to hear noises coming from
downstairs. In a panic Jeff rushed down and demanded to know "Who goes
there?!". Jeff was met with the answer of silence. Jeff felt there was a
surprise visitor in his house, this visitor felt cold though, almost other
worldly.

Once Jeff realises what is going on he begins to notice lights flickering and
the creaking sound of all the doors being swung open slowly. Jeff starts to run
back up the stairs, but then he hears the sound of thunder, and a storm of hail
begins outside. Jeff felt he was being haunted by something or someone. "Get
Out!" boomed a mysterious voice. The voice terrified Jeff
to his very core.

Jeff begun to sprint towards the door, like an animal running away from a
hunter. Each step Jeff took closer to the door made the house feel colder.
"You're to late" boomed the voice again. Jeff was so close to the door, yet he
felt something tugging on his leg, before Jeff had time to react he was being
pulled away screaming in terror...
