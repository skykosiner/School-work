# Section A
## Qustion 1
* "I liked the novelty"
* "The avalanche of information"

## Question 2
The writer feels conflictaed of how her mother treated her. She felt her mother
he didn't understand that not evyrone was like her and wanted to fit into the
typcial sterotype of a woman for the time. She didn't want to be seen as second
class citzen and she didn't understand why her mother thought that it was more
important for her brother to do better at school then her.

## Question 3
Deborah had always been told by her mother that becoming a teacher is a good
job for her as a woman and mother. But Deborah aspired for more in life, she
wanted to go to art collage. Her parents we're upset with her as they didn't
want her to leave her hometown of Motherwell. "This is your home, Deborah. Your
place is here, with us." Yet Deborah was confilicted by this as her mother
didn't stay with her family. "That was different. I moved where my husband
wanted to go" this futher backs up the idea from before that Deborah's Mother
was very much into the idea of woman more or less being propety of there
husband. In the end Deborah was told by her parents she's forbiden to go to art
collage. This most likely leaves Deborah with a choice in the end to take a
stand against her parents or to stand up for her self.

## Question 4
In text two Adeline Yen Mah uses an intresting combination of language
techniques to make the text more intresting for the reader. The use of the
simile "The thought of leaving school throbbed at the back of my mind like a
presistent toothache", suggests, to the reader that just like a toothache,
Adeline feels pain when thinks of having to go home. Adding the simile here
makes the writing more engangeing and intresting for the reader.

Futhermore in the first paragraph the use of the elpisies indicates Adeline
thinking about having to leave. She's shocked the time has come for to have
to go home even though she doesn't want to.

The use of the rhetorical question "How should I know?" when Adeline asks the
driver why's she going home shows that once again that Adeline is scared to go
home as not even the driver knows why's she going home, and it's not like her
family to invite her home unless they need to.

## Question 5
* Skiped

## Mental health
If you go back to the 80s, 90s, or even the early 00s, mental health was not
an a topic majority people talked about. Yet now in the age of the internet
mental health is more important then ever. If a teenager has bad mental health
it can affect everything from school, to social life, and even affect them once
they're adults.

In todays world mental health issues could come from so many things. Now yes
they could be having issues from there phone, but not eveyrthing can be blamed
on the phone. You may not want to hear this but sometimes parents not
understanding how to parent correctly can very easly mess up there kids mental
health.

Having bad mental health could leed down many paths, such as self harm, attemps
on sucide and much more. It's very important you make sure your teenagers have
good mental health.

## Influnce by celebritys/other big online persona
In todays world very ofetn you'll find your teenagers being a fan of a celibrty
and or a big online persona. While yes this is fine sometimes this can get out
of hand. Once again this leads to the idea of mental health. Such as you might
find your teenager being a fan of someone who's a model or into buety in
general, this could lead to a path of them belving they don't look good enough
or that they're to fat and could lead to them not eating anymore and staving
them self.
