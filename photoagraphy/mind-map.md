# Mind map
* Big dog and small dog
    * Dog nose looking big, dog nose looking small
        * Up close shot, and a far away shot
<!-- I kind of like this idea a lot -->
* Pictures of garden looking small, and then also the same garden looking big
    * Fish eye lens to make look big (like real estate photography)
