## Karl Blossfeldt
* June 13, 1865 – December 9, 1932
* Best known for close-up photos of plants and living things
* Developed a series of home made cameras that allowed him to photograph plant
surfaces in unprecedented, magnified detail

## How there development changed the landscape of photography
Karl Blossfeldt was one of the first photographers to do nature photography. He
developed his own camera to help him get up close photos of nature, previously
this was not possible.

If Karl Blossfeldt never developed this idea then we might not have micro
photography like we have.

## My thoughts on there photography
Looking back at these pictures in the modern world, they look old and grainy.
But even though they are not as detail clear as the pictures you see today,
these pictures seem to have a charm to them.

The detail shown is quite remarkable for one of the first cameras.
