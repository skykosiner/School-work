* Opninon on there photography

## Karl Blossfeldt
* June 13, 1865 – December 9, 1932
* Best known for close-up photos of plants and living things
* Developed a series of home made cameras that allowed him to photograph plant
surfaces in unprecedented, magnified detail

## How there development changed the landscape of photography
Karl Blossfeldt was one of the first photographers to do nature photography. He
developed his own camera to help him get up close photos of nature, previously
this was not possible.

If Karl Blossfeldt never developed this idea then we might not have micro
photography like we have.

## My thoughts on there photography
Looking back at these pictures in the modern world, they look old and grainy.
But even though they are not as detail clear as the pictures you see today,
these pictures seem to have a charm to them.

The detail shown is quite remarkable for one of the first cameras.

## Louis Daguerre
* 18 November 1787 – 10 July 1851
* Invented the daguerreotype method of taking photos
## How there development changed the landscape of photography
### Daguerreotype
* Daguerreotype was the first publicly available photography process
    * It was used widely during the 1840s and 1850s
        * The method was no longer from 1860s onwards
            * With new, less expensive processes, such as ambrotype

If it was not for the daguerreotype, we would not have portraits like we do today.
In fact photography might not have been developed till the 1980s for all we know.
## My thoughts on there photography
Unlike the photos of Karl Blossfeldt, I find the photos of Louis Daguerre quite
interesting. Looking at the pictures, they weirdly don't even look like
pictures, but they look like drawings. I find this effect (even thought it was
not an attend effect at the time, as that was the best they could do), really
fun and different to anything modern.
