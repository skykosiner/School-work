## Andrea Gulickx
Andrea Gulickx is mostly known for her workshops and presentations on macro
photography, abstract landscapes, and smartphone photography. Andrea never went
to school for photography, she taught her self everything she does. One of
Andreas biggest passion is macro photography. In fact for the first few years
of her photography career she only did/knew how to do macro photography.

## My thoughts on there photography
I personally really like Andrea Gulickx's photography. One of my favourite
types of photography is indeed Macro photography, so naturally as me and Andrea
Gulickx share a common love for macro photography I really do find her pictures
stunning.
