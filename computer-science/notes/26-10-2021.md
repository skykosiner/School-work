- When sending data with a websocket as a example it is better to use binary or
  a Unit 8 Bit Buffer as they take up less to send to the websocket server and
  all the other clients over a raw string or a raw number

- With the 8bit ascii character set one can only represnt a limited amount of
  characters even with 8 bit ascii you can not represent the symbols in
  languages such as French Spanish Italian and more

- To overcome these limitations we don't use ascii much now get good. We use
  UTF-8 as we can represent over 2,097,152 characters
