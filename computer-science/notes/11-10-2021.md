1. 8 bit per pixel (8 bits = 256 colors)
2. **A** Factor one: Black and white or in color <br /> **B** Factor two: how many ppi the image has
3. A 256 color icon with dimensions of 100x100 is bigger
4. **A** One: Where on the bitmap the pixel is <br /> **B** Two:
5. **A** Image B has less pixels than image a therefore it comes out more
   blurry <br /> **B** Once the image gets larger it becomes more blurry
   because as you zoom in the pixels become more clear to the eye (with
   something like a screen on your phone there is so many pixels that even when
   you put your eye up close you can't make out each individual pixel) <br />
   **C** Sending a lower resolution image will take up less bandwidth on a slow
   internet and will be faster to send
6. Two types of image compression our lossy and lossless.
    - With lossy compression, you can typically achieve a far better
      compression ratio as compared with lossless.
        - But with lossy if you want to edit your image it becomes a bit of a pain
    - With lossless compression the exact data is restored after re-compression
        - But the compression ratio is low unlike loss where the compression
          ratio is high
