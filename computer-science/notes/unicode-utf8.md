ONE BYTE IS 8 BITS
6 bytes is 48 bits

- A character set is a list of characters with unique numbers (these numbers
  are sometimes referred to as "code points"). For example, in the Unicode
  character set, the number for A is 41.

- An encoding on the other hand, is an algorithm that translates a list of
  numbers to binary so it can be stored on disk. For example UTF-8 would
  translate the number sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 like this:
```00000001 00000010 00000011 00000100```

- Unicode is the stuff like abcd utf-8 is just how that is encoded the number
  value

- UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format) and Unicode cannot be compared. UTF-8 is
an encoding used to translate numbers into binary data. Unicode is a character
set used to translate characters into numbers.
