1. Check 1-solve.png
2. **A** A internet browser (Brave, firefox, safari, and more) <br> **B**
   Search engine (Brave search, duck duck go, and more) <br> **C** A lot faster
   then looking for the correct book and then finding the answer in the book.
   Very fast to find what you are looking for. <br> **D** Anyone can post on
   the internet which means you could get a idiot posting on the internet
   something wrong. Such as if you search up I have a headache every day why?
   You might get someone saying you are dying then another person with the
   correct information saying maybe you are just tied, stressed etc...
3. Quick and convenient to make a transfer if you need to. Can quickly view
   your balance without leaving your house. Someone could launch some sort of
   xss attack to do bad things with your account.
