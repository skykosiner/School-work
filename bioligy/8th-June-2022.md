## What are the requirements for photosynthesises
* Water
* Carbon dioxide

## What are the products of photosynthesises
* Oxygen
* Glucose

### What are the products used for
The glucose and the oxygen is used for respiration to release energy. The
excess oxygen will be released into the air. The excess glucose is converted
into strati to be stored. Glucose can't be stored because it's soluble.

## Photo synthesis equation
carbon dioxide + water -> glucose + oxygen

* The water comes from the sail
* The carbon dioxide comes from the air

# Leaf structure
## What is the function of the waxy cuticle
* Reduces water loss
## What is unique about the upper epidermis
* They have no chloroplast, which means they are
transparent
    * So that the palaside cells can catch the sunlight
## What do the palaside cells do?
* Photosynthesises takes place in these cells
* They have got many chloroplast
* They are all packaged together closely, with no airspace
## Spongy mesophyll
* Gas exchange
## What is the function of stomata
* Let gasses in and out
    * CO2 (carbon dioxide) comes in and O2 (oxygen) is let out

## What solution do you use to test for starch
* Iodine
### What is the first step?
* Boil the leaf in hot water
    * Softens the cell walls
### What is the second step?
* Boil in ethanol
    * Removes the green pigment
        * This makes sure that the leaf is see through so that we can see if it changes
### What is the three step?
* Rince it off
### What is the four step?
* Place drops of iodine on the leaf
### What is the five step?
* Report/record the color change
    * If there is starch the indicator solution will change from orange/yellowish to blue/black
