## Explain why some plant cells conjoins many chloroplasts, some plant cells contain few chloroplasts, and some plant cells contain no chloroplasts
* Photosynthesises
* Absorbing Sunlight
* No chloroplast in the upper epidermis - transparent to let light
through to the plaside
* Plaside has loads of chloroplasts, it's the main place where
photosynthesises takes place in the plant

# Respiration
## Where in the body does respiration take place?
* Every single cell in the entire body
    * In the mitochondria to be more specific

## What are the requirements for respiration?
* Oxygen
    * Comes from the lungs (don't mention this one a lot, as it's illegal)
* Glucose
    * Comes from the food we eat

## What are the products of respiration?
* ATP - the energy
* Carbon dioxide - waste product
* Water - waste product

## What is ATP?
ATP = Adenosine Tri Phospate
* ATP is a energy carrier molecule

## Aerobic respiration
* The most common type
* As long as you have oxygen and glucose your body will do this one

## Anaerobic respiration
* No oxygen
* Will produce fair less energy
* Produce a waste product of latic acid that is harmful

## How does gas exchange take place in plants?
* Photosynthesises
* Air spaces in the Spongy mesophyll
* Oxygen
* Carbon dioxide
* Oxygen goes out
* Carbon dioxide moves in
