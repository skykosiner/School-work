1. Calculate the concentration of the following.
a) 0.02 g of NaCl dissolved in 15 cm3 of water.

15/1000 = 0.015
0.02/0.015 = 1.33

1.33 g/dm^3

b)  0.45 g of potassium hydroxide dissolved in 50cm3 of water.

50/1000 = 0.05
0.45 / 0.05 = 9

9g/dm^3

Calculate the number of moles of potassium hydroxide that must be dissolved to make the following solutions:

2. a) 500cm3 of 1 mol/dm3
3. 200cm3 of 0.5 mol/dm3
4. Calculate the concentration of each of the following solutions of hydrochloric acid:

 a) 1 mol of HCl dissolved to make 100cm3 of solution

  b) 2 mol of HCl dissolved to make 1dm3 of solution

Hint: find moles of sodium chloride
[11:10 PM] cypher: Then look at the formula
[11:11 PM] Yonithy - 45 1A4: so I want to find the moles of sodium chloride then do the equation
[11:11 PM] Yonithy - 45 1A4: ?
[11:11 PM] cypher: pretty much yeah
[11:11 PM] cypher: concentration = moles/volume
[11:11 PM] Yonithy - 45 1A4: Why thank you sir cypher
