* Paper chromatography is a technique for separating compounds of a mixture
    * Ink
    * Dyes
    * Additives
* When the solvent reaches the ink spots they are dissolved and carried with
the water as it moves up the paper
    * The most soluble ink travels the fastest, whilst the less water-soluble
    inks are left near the bottom of the paper
* Retention Factor
    * It is the ratio of the distance travelled by the sample (spots) to the
      distance traveled by the solvent (water)
* Distance moved by sample/distance moved by solvent
