* A molecule is a group of atoms joined together (eg: Oxygen: O2, Chlorine: Cl2)
* Formed when 2 or more elements combine in fixed proportions (water contains 2 hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atnom)
    * Elements are bonded together during a chemical reaction
    * Compounds can have properties that are very different than the elements they are made from
* At least 2 substances are mixed together
    * No chemical reaction takes place
    * Elements/compounds can be in any proportion
    * Can be separated by physical means:
        * Changing the temperature
        * Using a magnet
        * Using Water as a solvent to dissolve part of the mixture
