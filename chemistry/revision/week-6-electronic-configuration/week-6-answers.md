* 12 neutrons and 11 protons
    * The bottom number (11) is the number of protons (atomic number) the top number is the number of protons + neutrons (atomic mass). So basic math is you minus the top number by the bottom number, and boom you have the number of neutrons
* First shell: 2, Second shell: 8, Third Shell: 8
