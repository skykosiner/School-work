# What is the bottom number in the periodic table?
* topThe bottom number is the atomic number
## What is the atomic number?
* The number of protons in an atom of an element is its atomic number
<br /> Remember that:

* All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons atoms of different
elements have different numbers of protons An atom contains equal numbers of
protons and electrons
    * Since protons and electrons have equal and opposite charges, this means
      that atoms are have no overall electrical charge.
        * For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. Every sodium atom has
          11 protons and 11 electrons. It has 11 positive charges and 11
          negative charges.
# What is the top number on the periodic table
* The top number is the relative atomic mass
## What is relative atomic mass?
* The wight of a single atom of a specific elements
### Example
* Oxygens relative atomic mass or rfm is 16 grams so if you have 2 oxygen atoms the rfm will be 32
