## What is ionic bonding?
* An ionic bond is the transfer of the electrons from the metal atom, to the non metal atom

## Naming salts
If hydrochloric acid is used a metal chloride is made, is nitric acid is used a
metal nitrate is made, if sulphuric acid is used a metal sulfate

## Compound
* Two or more elements that are chemically combined

## Mixture
* Two or more elements not chemically combined

## Element
* A substance made of one type of atom

## Why are metals good conductors of electricity?
* A metal is a good conductor of electricity, because they have delocalised
electrons which are free to move, and can carry a current

# Electrolysis
For aqueous solution (dissolved in water), rule for positive electrode, if there
is a chloride, bromide or iodide there elements will form. If not oxygen will
form. At the negative electrode if the metal is more reactive then hydrogen
then hydrogen will form, if not the metal will form.
