### **A**
The social context in a film can be used to show the audience many things,
without ever mentioning it explicitly. Such as you can get an understanding of
how the protagonist grew up, by just having his family and town he grew up in,
on the screen for a minute.

### **B**
The setting for this film is in south Africa in the town of Johannesburg. A lot
of the people working at District 9, seem to be very scared/nervous about
everything, like there is some sort of secret going on, which is scarring them.

### **C**
In the opening scene of the film District 9, we see an employee explaining what
is going on in District 9. He seems very anxious. This is apparent as he is
constantly looking over his shoulder, and he's also speaking very nervously.

When we first see the aliens, we can see that they live in a society that is
in shambles. This helps to show that the aliens, don't seem to be on earth for
a purpose; it just seems like they have been sent here for no reason, with
nothing to do.
