(Video talking about music in film/tv)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSkJFs7myn0]

- Music can change your perspective watching a film
    - Making you feel intense, calm and a lot more emotions
        -  If you have the wrong music the film/show will not be as good as you
           can't as easily convey emotion with just words the musics adds to
           the emotion
- Music will make or break your video, film or tv show. It will allow the
  viewer to feel more emotion and let you feel what the characters are feeling

## How is diegetic and non-diegetic sound used to enhance the narrative in the opening of Skyfall?
## Diegetic and non diegetic mixed into one list (need to go through and separate them)
- The music playing in the background is building up the to the action as the
  beat is slowly getting higher and faster
- You can here bonds footsteps as he is approaching something or someone
- You also then here a door shut so you can tell someone has most likely just left
- You can here M in the background on a call or something to show that bond is
  not working alone he is on a mission as she says you don't have time and he
  did seemed to be looking for a hard drive when he first went in
- As bond goes outside you can here the beat go up at first it seems to be from
  the outside world but it seems to be in the film soundtrack to
    - This music is building up the action
- You can here the cars skidding it shows that they are finding it hard to
  control the cars in the chase as there are a lot of sharp turns
- As the gun shots begin to happen you can here people that sound scared trying
  to run away to safety
- You can also here the police coming in from the background to try and control
  the situation most likely
- The music is now even more dramatic to show the importance of this hard drive
  with a so called list on it
- You can here bricks and glass breaking as bond and the person he is chasing
  go through a window with the motorcycle
- As bond lands on the train you can here the train on the track and you can
  here the music get even louder as he he is hanging of the train to show that
  if he fools off he is in trouble
