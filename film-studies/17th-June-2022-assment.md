## Question 1 - Tsotsi
### A
Tsotsi, the young gangster. At the start of the film Tsotsi seems like a
gangster with zero hope, but throughout the film as we learn more about him and
his past, it seems there is hope.
### B
When we first see Tsoti he is standing at the window topless, with nothing bat
his trousers and pants on. The trousers look somewhat worn down, to show that
Tsotsi does not have a lot of money, and being a gangster is his only way of
survival.
### C
At the start of the film we can see Tsotsi standing at the window alone, while
his friends are sitting around playing a game, this could be a way of showing
that Tsotsi feels like he does not fit in with the others, and prefers to be
alone.

From they way they all turn to Tsotsi to ask what they are doing that night, it
establishes the basses that Tsotsi is the leader, even though he looks like the
youngest there.
### D
I'm going to be talking about the scene at Soekie's bar. This scene happens
after the murder/robbery of the man on the train. Soekie's bar is filled with
people of all ages, but the majority seem to be young people. Even though
earlier in the film we saw that this a town that struggles with hardship,
Soekie's bar looks like a place where people young people go to have
fun and dance.

In this scene a lot of close up camera angles are used on Tsoti's face. We
don't know Tsotsi's age, but from the way Tsotsi looks throughout the film so
far, it seems that he is young around 16 to 18, and that he is not an
experienced drinker, nor is he good with emotions. So Tsotsi very quickly gets
angry at teacher boy while he is talking about being a decent person.
## Question 2 - Submarine
### A
* Throughout the film there is a lot of darkly lit rooms
### B
Throughout the film Oliver feels everything is falling apart around
him. His parents breaking up, and his girlfriend (Jordanna) leaving him. All
thees thoughts and feelings leave Oliver to feel isolated, and the use of the
darkly lit rooms helps put across the depressing emotions that Oliver is
feeling.

### C
In the scene after Oliver finds out that Graham is his mother's ex, Oliver
spies on them at one of Graham's shows. This is the scene where Oliver starts
to feel isolated, as he believes his mother is having an affair, and he
believes that his girlfriend's mother might die which would cause them to break
up, and as these two feelings/thoughts start to build up in Oliver's head the
film slowly starts to take a darker approach of lighting from this scene
forward.

### D
I'm going to talk about the scene where Oliver shows his two weeks of love
making with Jordanna. The music in the background during this scene makes you
feel you're going on a journey with the two main characters and watching them
fell an love. There is strong use of fire during this scene, each part of the
scene has a least one mention of fire. Majority of the time in the shot the
fire is the only real use of color, other then Jordanna's coat.

Throughout the film whenever we see Jordanna she always seems to have colorful
cloths on (typically her coat), and Oliver always seems to have dark cloths
(typically his coat). This conveys that unlike Oliver Jordanna is an outgoing
and more open person, whereas Oliver tries to hide and lock up his feelings.
Also the use of color comes into play again, as Jordanna's coat reminds you of
the color of love. This is to keep the audience more engaged with her and Oliver.

During the scene where Oliver's mom asks Loyd (Oliver's dad) about cutting her
hair, there is very little use of color. It starts to give you the feeling that
they are growing father apart from one another, and it makes the scene feel
cold.
