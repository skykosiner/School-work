### Scene 1
[Start close up on laptop with vim and htop open. Main protagonist is clearly
sweating, looking like they are trying to get something done quickly. Then out of
no where there is a knocking at the door. Main protagonist looks up at the door
for a second, looks panicked, but does get back to the computer (trying to wipe
it now). Police sirens start Cut to wider view of the room that just about
shows the red and blue lights coming from the window.

Now the handle on the door is opened, and our protagonist looks shocked and gets
knocked out]


[Now the protagonist breaks the 4th wall, pooping up on a frozen frame of the last shot]
"Well you may be wondering how I got here? Well in order to find that out we have to go back 3 months" - Main protagonist

(Or maybe just have text on screen saying "3 Months Earlier")

### Scene 2
[Establishing shot of the house]

(Cut the audio of this into a bit of the establishing shot)
"I'm going to take the dogs for a walk" - main protagonist
"Alright, make sure you're home before sun down" - Someone in the house

[Leaves the house, shuts the door, walks to the end of the drive and spots a random car]
[Gunshot sound]
[The protagonist turns around instantly in horror]
[Phone rings]
[Protagonist picks up phone]

"Hello {insert name here}," - Evil dude
"Who the hell is this *strict/angry voice*" - Protagonist
"You're next"
[Music starts to get more intense as the phone is hanged up]

[Protagonist looks into a car, and can see a document. Make sure to only shoot
the back of the protagonist right now]
[The protagonist opens up his phone and goes to a contact called getaway driver]
[Within seconds the getaway driver comes zooming down the street, and drives of the protagonist]

[Cut back to the document in the car, it now slowly starts to zoom in (music
gets more intense), and the document says something along the lines of
wanted criminal {insert name here}, use lethal force if necessary. Screen now
cuts to black]
