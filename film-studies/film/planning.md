Title: Planning for final project to be filmed
Date: 5 April 2022
---

## My basic idea
### Scene 1
The main protagonist is hacking (just open htop, with a bit of vim and
the normies will think it's hacking) away (in 5th bedroom, of course it
make it look like a cooler place lol). After a few seconds (once it's clear
that the protagonist is hacking) knocking starts on the door, and the
protagonist starts to try and wipe the computer quickly.

After a few more seconds the protagonist starts to hear police sirens (cut to
the window and show blue and red light coming from outside). Then out of
nowhere the door gets kicked down and the protagonist gets knocked out.

Then the protagonist breaks the 4th wall (in same or different cloths hmmm),
and starts to say something along the lines of:

> Well you may be wondering how I got into this situation, well in order to find that out we need go back 3 months
### Scene 2
Start off with saying to mom or someone else, I'm going to take the dogs for a
walk. After the protagonist gets out of the house and reach the end of athe
drive way we cut to a bedroom to the back of a bad guy, while at the back we
here a gun shot. Then cut back to the protagonist where the phone rings.

The protagonist picks up after being hesitant for a second, the bad guy says:
> We're coming...
Then hangs up

The protagonist then starts to panic wondering what is going on.

Then the protagonist looks into a car and sees a document (yet the viewer can't
see the document). The protagonist then calls a friend to pick to him up, and
after we see them drive off we cut back to the car and start to zoom in on the
document, and the screen slowly fades to black.
